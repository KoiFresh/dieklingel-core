; core.ini - the configuration file to tell the core how to behave
;
; This file is loaded by the core once on startup and used to configure the
; behaviour of the core.
;

;
; The "core.qml" category is used to define the graphical section also called
; "kiosk" of the core.
;
[core.qml]

; Tells the core if the kiosk should be enabled or not.
;
; Default: false
enabled=false

; If the kiosk is enabled the core looks for an qml file as entry point
; defining the graphical kiosk interface. The path could be absolute or
; relative from the working directory of the core.
;
; Default: qml/main.qml
entry=qml/main.qml

;
; The "core.sip" category is used to define the SIP integration of the core.
;
[core.sip]

; Tells the core if SIP should be used or not.
;
; Default: false
enabled=false

; If SIP is enabled the core needs a single SIP account to register on a SIP
; Proxy. The username and the proxy is set in the address in the format
; sip:<username>@<proxy domain or ip>[:<port>].
;
; Default:
address=sip:user2@192.168.0.92

; The password which sohuld be used for the user set in the core.sip/address.
;
; Default:
password=secure_password

; Sets the devicename for the preffered audio device used for capturing audio.
; This is useful for e.g. if you use the pipewire echo-cancel module.
; See: https://docs.pipewire.org/page_module_echo_cancel.html
;
; Default:
capture-device=PulseAudio Unknown: Echo-Cancel Source

; Sets the devicename for the preffered audio device used for playing audio.
; This is useful for e.g. if you use the pipewire echo-cancel module.
; See: https://docs.pipewire.org/page_module_echo_cancel.html
;
; Default:
playback-device=PulseAudio Unknown: Echo-Cancel Sink

; Sets the transport type which can by used to establish a connection to the
; sip proxy. All protocol which are in the list, can be used by the client.
; Possible values are "udp", "dtls", "tcp", "tls".
;
; Default: tcp, tls
transports=tcp, tls

;
; The "core.mqtt" category is used to define the mqtt intergration of the core.
;
[core.mqtt]

; Tells the core if mqtt should be used or not.
;
; Default: false
enabled=false

; If mqtt is enabled the core needs a broker to connect to. The broker is set
; in the address in the format <broker domain or ip>:<port>.
;
; Default:
address=my-mqtt-broker.com:1883

; The username used for the mqtt broker.
;
; Default:
username=mqtt

; The password used for the mqtt broker.
;
; Default:
password=mqtt

; A list of all mqtt topics which the core should subscribe to.
;
; Default:
subscriptions=home/light/main/door, home/light/back/door

;
; The "core.env" section is used to set environment variables. The core does
; set the variables immediatly after starting and loading the config, before
; the main (graphical) application is started. The variables could be used for
; example to set the platform for the underlaying qt-framework or to set the
; wayland display. Because the core is already launched when the variables are
; set the "core.env" category could not be used to set variables like
; LD_PRELOAD. Furthermore the core provides a function to read environment
; variables from qml. So this section could be used to define e.g. an qml text.
;
[core.env]

; see: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qguiapplication.html#platformName-prop
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland

; The following variables shouldn't be interpreted as integration. We use the
; ability to set and pass enviornment variables to the application and read
; them from qml to configure the user interface.
